### Overview :suspect:
OpenARB is an open source program aiming to emulate a free market while encouraging players to participate in arbitrage in order to increase working capital.

### The Loop :loop:
The mechanics are rather simple. Just follow the prompts and use your best judgement to turn a profit by making the right calls at the right times. Be warned though, you’ll be going into this thing with an outstanding debt that will need to be repaid in a timely manner, or you’ll drown in debt (game over). A bit like a student loan run rife, but a little more … finite.

### Future :chart_with_upwards_trend:
- [ ] Seperate out function definitions into separate modules.
- [ ] Improve market reroll.
- [ ] Add random event mechanic.
